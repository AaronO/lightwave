Build instructions
------------------

First you need to build the lightwaveot library.
The samples need as well the federation library lightwavefed.

cd ot
make
make install
cd ../federation
make
make install

Now you might want to try the sample code
cd samples/gocurses
make
make install
cd ../p2p_editor
make

See the README of the p2peditor on instructions how to start the software.

Then continue exploring the samples p2p_server and p2p_client

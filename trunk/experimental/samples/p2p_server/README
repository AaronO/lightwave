P2PServer is a simple collaboration server that speaks the same replication/sync protocol as P2PEditor, but provides no UI itsef. It listens on an additional socket to allow incoming connections from P2PClient.

The command line options are the same as for p2peditor, with addition to the

-s ":8989"

flag which will make the server accept client connections on port 8989.

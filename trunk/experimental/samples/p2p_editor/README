P2PEditor is a simple collaborative editor that runs in a terminal window.

Launch the first instance like this:

./p2peditor -l ":12345" 2>out

This redirects the debug output to 'out' and listens on localhost port 12345.
Now open more console and start more editors. These editors must know how to contact each other.
Therefore, you can tell each editor to which other editor it should connect.
Ultimatively, the editors form an unstructured P2P network.

./p2peditor -l ":12346" -p ":12345" 2>out2

This starts a second editor and makes it connect with the first one.

./p2peditor -l ":12347" -p ":12346" 2>out2

This starts a third editor and connects it with the second one.
All edits are flooded between all editors. Thus, if you type in one console, you can see how the others update as well.

KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS
==================

'q': Quit

's': Suspend
     This will suspend the forwarding of mutations.
     The purpose is to create concurrent operations by suspending two editors, then typing, and later resuming both.
     This way you can see how OT merges the concurrent edits.

'r': Resume

Yes, these shortcuts mean you cannot type q, s, or r. Feel free to patch it :-)

P2PClient is a simple collaborative editor that runs in a terminal window but is not able to federate itself. It must always be connected to a P2PServer.

First you must launch a server like this:

../p2p_server/p2pserver -l ":12345" -s ":8989" 2>out

Now you can starts a client and connect to the server.

./p2pclient -s ":8989" 2>out2

The client can collaborate with other clients connected to the same server and to all other peers participating in the federation.

It is important to see that the OT algorithms used on the client are only a subset of the federation OT and the client/server protocol is very lean because there is no need to pass around hash codes etc.
This makes clients easier to implement and the C/S communication more efficient.

KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS
==================

'q': Quit

's': Suspend
     This will suspend the forwarding of mutations.
     The purpose is to create concurrent operations by suspending two editors, then typing, and later resuming both.
     This way you can see how OT merges the concurrent edits.

'r': Resume

Yes, these shortcuts mean you cannot type q, s, or r. Feel free to patch it :-)

Dependencies
============

lightwave is implemented in GO. Download it from http://golang.org and compile and
install it.

lightwave uses a simple sqlite database. Install the GO wrappers from
http://code.google.com/p/gosqlite. Compile and install the GO wrappers.
On some systems you need to install sqlite3 and the corresponding C header files
first, before the GO wrappers can be compiled

File structure
==============

/webroot
        This is the web-based front-end of lightwave

/gosrc
        The GO implementation of the lightwave server

/gosrc/lib
        The implementation of the server without the HTTP front-end

/gosrc/server
        Contains the main function and implements the HTTP front end
        and server configuration/startup

/gosrc/lightwave.config.example
        Copy to gosrc/lightwave.config and adapt it to your settings.
        Basically it just defined the port and enumerates the virtual
        servers.

/gosrc/localhost.config.example
        Copy to gosrc/localhost.config. This is the configuration file for
        a virtual server. Make sure that all virtual servers are listed in
        the lightwave.config file.

/gosrc/server/lightwave
        The server executable. It is a stand-alone server with a HTTP
        interface. Use your web browser and point it to http://host:port/index.html.

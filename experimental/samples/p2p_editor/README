P2PEditor is a simple collaborative editor that runs in a terminal window.

Launch the first instance like this:

./p2peditor -u "b@bob" -l ":8181" 2>out

The editor will create its own blob store and accept replication connections via port 8181.
The editor is running on behalf of user "b@bob".
The above command line redirects the debug output to 'out' to avoid interference with the UI.

Now open more consoles and start more editors. These editors must know how to contact each other.
Therefore, you can tell each editor to which other editor it should connect.
Ultimatively, the editors form a directed graph.
All editors are running the replication protocol, i.e. they try to keep each other in sync.
This scenario is useful if one user is replicating his blobs on multiple machines.

To start a second editor for user "b@bob@ proceed as follows:

./p2peditor -u "b@bob" -l ":8282" -r ":8181" 2>out2

The second editor will try to connect to port 8181 to sync itself with this remote blob store.
Now a third editor can be started as follows:

./p2peditor -u "b@bob" -l ":8383" -r ":8181" 2>out3

All edits are flooded between all editors because the replication mechanism keeps them in sync. Thus, if you type in one console, you can see how the others update as well.

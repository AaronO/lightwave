P2PEditor is a simple collaborative editor that runs in a terminal window.

Launch the first instance like this:

./p2peditor -l "fed1.com" 2>out

This editor does not behave as if it owns the domain "fed1.com".
The file nameservice.com maps domain names (e.g. fed1.com) to local ports for testing purposes:

fed1.com -> localhost 8181
fed2.com -> localhost 8282
...
fed5.com -> localhost 8585

In real systems, the nameservice will use DNS to lookup the respective servers.

The above command line redirects the debug output to 'out' and listens on localhost port 8181.
Now open more console and start more editors. These editors must know how to contact each other.
Therefore, you can tell each editor to which other editor it should connect.
Ultimatively, the editors form an unstructured P2P network.

./p2peditor -l "fed2.com" -p "fed1.com" 2>out2

This starts a second editor and makes it connect with the first one.

./p2peditor -l "fed3.com" -p "fed1.com" 2>out2

This starts a third editor and connects it with the second one.
All edits are flooded between all editors. Thus, if you type in one console, you can see how the others update as well.
